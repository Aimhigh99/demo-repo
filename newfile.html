    <h1>Hurray!!!!</h1>
    <p>
        After lots of searching, I have finally found an instructor. She is taking me through how to use git and github.
        🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
    </p>
    <strong>I am now feeling like a real programmer 🤣🤣🤣🤣</strong>
    <p>I am crazy! I know. But by the time you find this I would have very very very very familiar with git and github.
        I may even have published a tutorial on it. Cus why not? It's called giving back to the community.</p>
